NOTES

any command like "Class obj;" will lead to calling to Class constructor,
if Class has any object of class "Class2" in its attributes Class2 default constructor 
will be called automatically before actually calling the constructor of parent class

if class "Class" has an attribute of class "Class2", calling explicitly Class2
constructor in Class constructor will lead to have multiple unnecessary calls to the
Class2 constructor for the same object and a waste of performance
use initializer list to call the constructor only once in its desired version 
basically here initializer list inhibits the call to default Dummy constructor that 
"Entity e(777)" would be making automatically and calls the int constructor instead

in cases like line 29 if there isnt any compatible costructor a full copy will be made
