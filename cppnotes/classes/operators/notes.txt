postfix vs prefix inrement/decrement operators

Entity operator++(int a) -> postfix

 output cant be a ref because the returned value is actually another brand new value
 while the memory containing the old value gets modified
 
 who is a? usually unused (i guess its only to indentify if the postfix or prefix
 version is being used), its default value is 0 but if needed can be actually passed as 
 parameter and used into function by calling it explicitly ( e.operator++(69); )
