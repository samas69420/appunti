NOTE
problem: when a sub-class is used as its parent and call a overwritten method the
         partent version is used instead of the overwritten one
solution: mark as virtual the overwritten method in parent definition
          "virtual" tells compiler that if the method is overwritten the ow version
          should be used instead of the default implementation
