NOTE 
singletons are classes that will be instanciated only once

QUESTIONS
why size is 1? -> Any instantiable object in C++ needs to be able to be identified at 
                  an address in memory. That means at least one byte must be allocated
                  in memory
why can instanciate unique_instance if it is private? -> static members must be declared
                                                         outside class

singleton2 is a variation of singleton that uses a static variable inside "get" function
instead of using a static member, this makes possible to avoid declaring static stuff in
the global scope
