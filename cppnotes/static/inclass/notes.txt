NOTE
"static" in file is like private for a class but for translation unit
"static" in class shares the same value among all instances
good practice for file case: everything should be marked static if it wont be shared
static members (Vehicle::static_x) must be declared only in global scope
(i guess because they will stay in memory like global variables)
