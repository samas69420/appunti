NOTE
smart pointers are basically pointers + some functions and rules to manage the memory 
they point to, stuff like calling constrctors/destructors automatically etc
examples:
unique ptr -> can be the only one pointing to the data
shared ptr -> data gets deleted only when noone points to it
weak ptr -> doenst change refcount but knows if its data is still valid
