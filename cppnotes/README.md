## overview
this folder is a collection of cpp examples that i wrote down while watching the playlist from the cherno (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb) which is in my opinion one the bests cpp playlists on youtube

please note that the code in this repo is not always a copypaste of the code in the videos but in some cases the examples in this repo are slightly different

I've started watching the playlist and writing examples because i wanted to learn some C++ features and keywords after using only C for a while and for this reasons there are currently no examples about the most basic concepts like variables and loops at all (but i will not stop anyone who wants to add them)

this repo is focused on the syntax and semantics of the language itself more than on the std library or on the various concepts and paradigms, the goal is not having examples about like "what is oop" but rather about something like "how does cpp handle oop"

## examples structure
every example consists in one folder named like the topic of the example you will find in it, and it contains three types of file	
- a build file (.sh and .bat) that you can execute to test the example (you will need g++ compiler to be installed)
- a notes file with some general considerations about that particular topic
- one or more source files with a maximum of 50 lines of code in total + lines specific comments

this last thing is because i think a example should be easy and fast to read and should be focused on only one thing instead of bringing many concepts to focus on in the scene

all examples about close topics are grouped together in a folder like the "classes" folder that contains all oop related examples 

## who are these notes intented for?
i think those who will enjoy this repo more can be divided in two main categories
- people that are currently following the playlist from cherno and wants to see some more code
- devs coming from other languages interested in cpp syntax but already familiar with programming concepts

## how to contribute 
any contribution would be appreciated like if want to add notes or comments, or you spot any mistake and want to fix it or also if you want to add any example about a specific topic that you think should be included in this repo but is currently missing, just make sure to use the same structure described above
